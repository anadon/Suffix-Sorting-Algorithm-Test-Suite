BUILDING

# make

CLEANING

# make clean

TESTING

# ./tests.sh

By running tests.sh, it will automatically perform 100 tests of each 
program over each test input file printing out programs and file names
as they change, and run information is printed at the number of 
executed instructions on the CPU and the peak memory usage in KB as 
seperated columns, with each row being a distinct run.
